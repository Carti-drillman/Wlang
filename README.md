# Wlang Interpreter

**Wlang** is an esoteric programming language (esolang) built for fun, featuring a unique syntax inspired by disliked comments and memes. This project provides a web-based interpreter for Wlang written in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- Simple syntax with commands represented by phrases and emojis.
- Supports memory manipulation, input, output, and no-op commands.
- Built-in examples to help you get started.
- Interactive interface with an editor and command reference.

## Commands in Wlang

Hereâ€™s a list of Wlang commands and what they do:

| Command                             | Action                                   |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `ðŸ™„ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡`                        | Increment the memory by 1              |
| `Clean your teeth, bro`             | Decrement the memory by 1              |
| `WTF is this, bro?`                 | Output the current memory value         |
| `Green screen kid ðŸ˜‚`                | Prompt the user to input a number       |
| `bruh`                              | No operation (does nothing)            |
| `The bug is gay because I saw it`   | Ignored command                        |

## How It Works

The interpreter uses a single memory variable (an integer) to store values, which can be manipulated using the commands. Lines of Wlang code are executed sequentially.

## Usage

### Online Demo
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
2. Write your Wlang code in the editor.
3. Refer to the command sheet displayed on the side.
4. Click the **Run Code** button to execute your program.
5. View the output in the result area.

### Example Programs

#### 1. Increment and Output
```plaintext
ðŸ™„ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
ðŸ™„ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
WTF is this, bro?
